## This project does not get updated any more, the reason is i made $50 on it for 8 months, while other devs stole it and resold it and made over $100.000, I will not update it again so do not ask me.  To the bot community, i will never release a tool again for you guys, i was the creator of massviewer and this.. and still i never got anything out of it except for more protection from IG because it was sold the the masses.. So nextpost, ektor and massviewer.com fuck you guys. (Also fuck you instabot for trying to steal my project over to your own repo and fuck you Daniel for trying to DMCA claim this repo because I used your free framework!)

# InstabotAI

Instabotai is an instagram bot with face detection that uses the undocumented Web API. Instabotai can reupload photo to feed, reupload photo to stories, watch stories, comment, like and DM users if a face is detected on image.
Unlike other bots, Instabotai does not require Selenium or a WebDriver. Instead, it interacts with the API over simple HTTP Requests. It runs on most systems.
